First of all, I would like to thank the [Drupal](http://drupal.org) organization for giving me this opportunity to participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Before starting coding, there is a period of Community bonding. The following is a little summary of the period

During The community bonding period, my mentor thinks that learning a song can help improve my ability of public communication, so I learn The song [Love The Way You Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U).Â It's a challenge for me.

The main of this song is Rap, which I think is very difficult. On the one hand, it needs accurate rhythm, on the other hand, there are a lot of lyrics. It's full of new words for me, at least 15% or 20%. I printed out the lyrics and looked up words I didn't know how to pronounce.But I can only sing a small segment in public because it's really difficult. Finally I had to read the lyrics out.

This week began to code, I feel very good, I will continue to work hard.
