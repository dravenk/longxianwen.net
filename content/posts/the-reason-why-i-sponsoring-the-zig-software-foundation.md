I was sponsoring the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) software foundation. 

> [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

I was interested in the Rust programming language, and I built a middleware in Rust for my work. I learned more about the Rust then I found the rust community is the poison. The leading team of Rust is a dictator. I'm not going to talk too much about rust, just provide some relevant information.

[CrabLang, the Rust fork](https://github.com/crablang/crab)  
[The Rust I Wanted Had No Future](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html)

I try to seek a programming language that can be instead of Rust. Then I found the Zig programming language. The zig is also a low-level programming languge the same as C, C++, Rust. The Zig have many properties that I want.

> No hidden control flow.  
> No preprocessor, no macros.

The Zig programming language is led by the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) but doesn't mean the Zig community is a dictator.
